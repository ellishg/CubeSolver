# CubeSolver
Another Rubik's cube solver using Thistlethwaite's algorithm.

I wanted to see how fast I could make my rubik's cube solver. I am happy to say that my solver give solutions with about 35 moves in about 15 milliseconds. I would have loved to make an optimal solver, but I also did not want to use gigabytes of memory for lookup tables and wait hours for my solver to finish. Unfortunately iOSCube will probably remain unfinished.
