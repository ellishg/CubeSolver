# CubeSolver
Another Rubik's cube solver using Thistlethwaite's algorithm.

Use Xcode to compile and run easily.

* Use the "U, D, L, R, F, B" keys to rotate the faces.
* Use the "M" key to mix the cube.
* Use the "S" key to generate a solution.
* Use the arrow keys to rotate the cube.
* Use the "P" key to print the current cube state.

I wanted to see how fast I could make my rubik's cube solver. I am happy to say that my solver give solutions with about 35 moves in about 15 milliseconds. I would have loved to make an optimal solver, but I also did not want to use gigabytes of memory for lookup tables and wait hours for my solver to finish. Unfortunately iOSCube will probably remain unfinished.
